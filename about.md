Hi, I'm Saif Garasia! I'm planning to write several pages over my love for music and reviewing several albums as they come by. New, old, you name it! This blog will likely be a weekly schedule but I plan to do some double posts over some weeks to keep the blog fresh. If you have any suggestions about this blog or the music I review, you can email me at saifgarasia@gmail.com. Thank you!
